So, i decided to build a PCB hotplate. Yes i had decided to make it before it was put up as ideas on [highway](https://highway.hackclub.com) website.

Yeah so i am gonna start a bit of research.
What i think i need is that first of all a controller(I think i am gonna use the OG RP2040), then i need a mosfet which can handle high current, i would need a voltage regulator for the RP2040, and i would need copper tracks and i would need a thermistor or a temperature sensor.
