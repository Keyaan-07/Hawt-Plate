So, i decided to build a PCB hotplate. Yes i had decided to make it before it was put up as ideas on [highway](https://highway.hackclub.com) website.

Yeah so i am gonna start a bit of research.
What i think i need is that first of all a controller(I think i am gonna use the OG RP2040), then i need a mosfet which can handle high current, i would need a voltage regulator for the RP2040, and i would need copper tracks and i would need a thermistor or a temperature sensor. 

Okay, [this](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/MOSFETs_UTC-Unisonic-Tech-UT20N03L-TN3-R_C171442.html) is the mosfet i decided to go with. [This](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Voltage-Regulators-Linear-Low-Drop-Out-LDO-Regulators_JSMSEMI-AMS1117S-3-3_C917152.html) is the voltage regulator i decided. Can't find a good thermistor now i'll look tomorrow.


GUESS WHO FOUND [A GOOD THERMISTOR](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/NTC-Thermistors_Dersonic-NTDM1003FB39500148_C5355638.html) IN JUST A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE LAST COMMIT BECAUSE I COULDN'T WAIT TILL TOMORROW
